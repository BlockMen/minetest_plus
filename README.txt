Minetest+  -  a game for the Minetest game engine [based on minetest_game]
=========
Version 0.2

About this game
---------------
Minetest+ tries to be as near as possible at the default game (Minetest_game), but with a few improved things and a few new features.

Namely these tweaks are based on "Default Plus" mod, which changes following:

New items:
- Charcoal (by putting a tree log in furnace) (1 tree -> 1 charcoal)
- Hardened Clay (by putting a clay block in furnace) (1 clayblock -> 1 hardened clay)
Changed Appearance:
- Cactus have spikes
- Ice is semi-transparent
- Water has a better color and brightness (under water aswell)
- Glass is semi-transparent
Changed Behavior:
- Flowing water makes sound
- Lava makes sound and spawns randomly particles
- Cactus damage Players [Mobs not tested yet]
- You get 4 Stonebricks instead 1 Stonebrick
- Torches can also be crafted with charcoal
- Leaves dont decay when placed by player
- Dirt with snow turns into Dirt with Grass when snow is digged

Furthermore this game has fancy 3d torches, based on my torches mod and it includes the doors mod aswell the intweak mod.


Other changes:
- chests drop stuff when digged
- removed bones mod
- new character texture
- grass and flowers get digged immediate
- more grass is spawned
- uses new damage sound
- tweaked textures of grass, water and papyrus

So hope you enjoy this game and like the changes i made to default game.
