Using the mod:
--------------

This mod changes the HUD of Minetest. It adds a costum crosshair, a improved health bar. 
Also it adds hunger to the game and and hunger bar to the HUD.

Furthermore it disables the current way of drowning (credits go to PilzAdam) and it will have an LUA-based drowing next versions.
